## PROG12583 Programming Foundations - Python: Assignment 1
Program: **Computer Programming @ Sheridan College** <br>
Note: The following assignment was completed during Semester 1 (2023) <br>

## The Task:
Create a program called TheShape that calculates one of the three shapes: üîºüìò‚è∫Ô∏è 

## The Details: 
The Home Menu prompts the user to enter: 
<ul>
  <li>1 for a Triangle Calculation</li>
  <li>2 for a Rectangle Calculation</li>
  <li>3 for a Circle Calculation</li>
</ul>

Triangle Calculations: 
<ul>
  <li>prompt the user for height and base</li>
  <li>print out Triangle Area</li>
</ul>

Rectangle Calculations: 
<ul>
  <li>prompt the user for width and length</li>
  <li>print out the Rectangle's area and perimeter</li>
</ul>

Circle Calculations: 
<ul>
  <li>prompt the user for radius</li>
  <li>print out the Circle's diameter</li>
</ul>

Conditions: 
<ul>
  <li>if the user chooses a negative number for shape choice then print out "negative shape not allowed", no further calculations or prompts should appear and program ends with your name and student number</li>
  <li>if the user chooses an invalid number for shape choice then print out "invalid shape choice", no further calculations or prompts should appear, and program wnds with your name and student number</li>
</ul>

After printing out the calculation, prompt the user for ‚ú®Color Choice‚ú®: 
<ul>
  <li>1 for Red</li>
  <li>2 for Blue</li>
  <li>3 for Green</li>
</ul>

Print out the shape and color choice of the user: 
<ul>
  <li>if the user chooses triangle and blue then the program prints out "blue triangle"</li>
  <li>if the user chooses circle and green the program prints out "green circle"</li>
  <li>if the user chooses a negative number for color then print out "negative number not allowed", and the program ends with your name and student number</li>
  <li>if the user chooses a invalid number for color then print out "invalid number not allowed", and the program ends with your name and student number</li>
</ul>

## Thoughts/Comments: 
This assignment definitely showed me that there is always a way to simplify your code. I also discovered that I am the type of person who would sprinkle my code with plenty of comments as it is easy for me to get lost.
